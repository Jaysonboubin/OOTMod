This is a romhack of the original nintendo Legend of Zelda game for the NES that I made to propose to my now wife. I modified the binary of an original rom to create the hack, then wrote the rom onto a chip and soldered it back onto the original cart. I'm mainly putting this on GH for my own storage, but if anyone would like to download it and run it, or modify the rom themselves, then go ahead.

***Disclaimer: This rom is modified from Nintendo's original game, which I did not create. I did not profit off of this and do not intend to. It is HEAVILY modified, to the point that almost all of the original game is inaccessible. I am not putting this here in an attempt to illegally distribute copyrighted material, just to display my work.
